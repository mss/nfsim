TODO
 * implement --linear-skb mode for older (buggy) kernels.
 * implement rtable/dst routing, needed for:
 	path MTU (currently is fixed at 1500)
	ipt_MASQUERADE
 * ifconfig support for multiple addresses on interfaces
 * allow newlines in XML help CDATA sections

way off:
 * protocols should be more modular - probably some registration function for
   a (protocol_id, handler, local_handler) tuple.
 * allow symbol table lookups (libbfd) to resolve function names, for things
   like timer_list->function debugging.
