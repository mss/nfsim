nfsim - netfilter simulation environment

http://ozlabs.org/~jk/projects/nfsim/

The netfilter simulator provides a means to run netfilter code in userspace;
this allows significantly easier debugging and testing of what would otherwise
be kernel-bound code.

nfsim is released under the GNU General Public License. See the file COPYING
for details.


Quick start:

# import netfilter code from the currently running kernel
./configure --kerneldir=<kernel directory>

# build
make

# run
./simulator


Notes on testing:

* Compilation will require the docbook xsl stylesheets and dtds to generate
  inline help. These are provided by the following packages:
  
  	Debian: docbook-xsl docbook-xml xsltproc
  	Redhat: docbook-style-xsl docbook-dtds
	
  During the 'configure' stage, symlinks are created to the directories
  containing docbook data:

  	Debian:
	doc/link-xhtml -> /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh
	doc/link-dtd -> /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dtd/xml/4.2

	Redhat:
	doc/link-xhtml -> /usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets
	doc/link-dtd -> /usr/share/sgml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.2-1.0-17

  If compilation fails on one of the -help files, you may have to manually
  create the links (doc/link-xhtml and doc/link-dtd) to the appropriate
  locations:

  * the 'link-xhtml' symlink needs to contain xhtml/docbook.xsl 
  * the 'link-dtd' symlink needs to contain docbookx.dtd

* Simulator development was based on the 2.6 kernel code, so hasn't been tested
  as thoroughly with 2.4 source, but should still work fine. I'd suggest
  developing under 2.6 and then backporting to 2.4.

* If custom netfilter modules are under test, they may rely on kernel features
  that are not yet implemented in the simulator. If this is the case, send
  an email with a link to the addon module(s) and a description of the
  problem.

* the .config used for a build is sourced from the .config.sample in the top
  build directory. If your custom netfilter module needs any .config directives,
  add them to the .config after the 'make import'
